# DSA-Mastery
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations, practice problems, and academic lab material. It covers both foundational and advanced topics such as sorting, recursion, trees, hashing, heaps, stacks, queues, and more, supporting structured learning and interview preparation.

## DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation)
Focuses on dynamic memory management concepts including pointers, heap allocation, memory leaks, and efficient memory usage in programming.

## Linked List, Sorting, Searching, Recursion
A combined folder covering linked list operations, searching algorithms, sorting techniques, and recursive problem-solving approaches.

## Recursion and Backtracking
Contains recursive algorithms and backtracking problems such as permutations, combinations, N-Queens, maze solving, and constraint-based problem solving.

## Advanced Sorting
Contains implementations and practice problems related to advanced sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and hybrid sorting techniques, along with time and space complexity analysis.

## Stack and Queues
Covers stack and queue implementations, variations (circular queue, deque), and real-world applications such as expression evaluation and scheduling.

## Hashing and Types
Covers hashing techniques, collision resolution strategies, hash tables, and various hashing methods used in efficient data retrieval.

## Heap and Priority Queue
Includes implementations of heaps (min-heap, max-heap) and priority queues, along with applications such as scheduling, heap sort, and optimization problems.

## String Search
Includes string matching algorithms such as Naive Search, KMP, Rabin-Karp, and pattern matching techniques.

## Trees and AVL
Covers tree data structures including binary trees, BSTs, AVL trees, and related operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and balancing.
