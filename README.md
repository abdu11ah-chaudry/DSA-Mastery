# DSA-Mastery
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations, practice problems, and academic lab material. It covers both foundational and advanced topics such as sorting, recursion, trees, hashing, heaps, stacks, queues, and more, supporting structured learning and interview preparation.

##🔹 DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation)
Focuses on dynamic memory management concepts including pointers, heap allocation, memory leaks, and efficient memory usage in programming.

##🔹 Linked List, Sorting, Searching, Recursion
A combined folder covering linked list operations, searching algorithms, sorting techniques, and recursive problem-solving approaches.

##🔹 Advanced Sorting
Contains implementations and practice problems related to advanced sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and hybrid sorting techniques, along with time and space complexity analysis.
